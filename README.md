# Guide to Letters
The idea is to help people reduce the time it takes to edit text after copying from a PDF file, for example journalists. The ugly text from the copied PDF splices lines together until certain punctuation occurs. Along the way, it removes extra spaces, and also, if desired, removes the dash at the end of the word at the end of the 1st line.
